Keep in mind, the PyMdown extensions were designed to work with the default extensions, so your mileage may vary in regards to compatibility when paired with other 3 rd party extensions. All extensions are found under pymdownx . Assuming we wanted to specify the use of the MagicLink extension, we would include it in Python Markdown like so: >>> import markdown >>> text = \"A link https://google.com\" >>> html = markdown . markdown ( text , [ 'pymdownx.magiclink' ]) '<p>A link <a href=\"https://google.com\">https://google.com</a></p>' Check out documentation on each extension to learn more about how to configure and use each one. Reminder Please read the Usage Notes for information on extension compatibility and general notes to be aware of when using these extensions. Extensions \ue157 Arithmatex Arithmatex is an extension that preserves LaTeX math equations ( \\frac{\\sqrt x}{y^3} \\frac{\\sqrt x}{y^3} ) during the Markdown conversion process so that they can be used with MathJax . B64 B64 converts all local images in a document to base64 encoding and embeds them in the document. BetterEm BetterEm is a different approach to emphasis than Python Markdown's default. It works similar but handles certain corner cases differently. Caret Caret is an extension that is syntactically built around the ^ character. It adds support for inserting super scripts and adds an easy way to place text in an < ins > tag. Critic Critic adds handling and support of Critic Markup . Details Details creates collapsible elements with < details >< summary > tags. Click Me! Thanks! Emoji Emoji makes adding emoji via Markdown easy . EscapeAll EscapeAll allows the escaping of any character, some with additional effects. Check it out to learn more. Extra Extra is just like Python Markdown's Extra package except it uses PyMdown Extensions to substitute similar extensions. ExtraRawHTML ExtraRawHTML exposes Python Markdown's feature of parsing markdown in HTML blocks. No longer do you have to include all of Extra when all you want to do is parse Markdown in HTML blocks. Highlight Highlight allows you to configure the syntax highlighting of SuperFences and InlineHilite. Also passes standard Markdown indented code blocks through the syntax highlighter. InlineHilite InlineHilite highlights inline code: from module import function as func . Keys Keys makes inserting key inputs into documents as easy as pressing Ctrl \uff0b Alt \uff0b Del . MagicLink MagicLink linkafies URL and email links without having to wrap them in Markdown syntax. Also, allows shortens repository issue, pull request, and commit links. You can even use easily insert mentions: @twitter . Mark Mark allows you to mark words easily. PathConverter PathConverter converts paths to absolute or relative to a given base path. ProgressBar ProgressBar creates progress bars quick and easy. SmartSymbols SmartSymbols inserts commonly used Unicode characters via simple ASCII representations: =/= \u2192 \u2260. Snippets Snippets include other Markdown or HTML snippets into the current Markdown file being parsed. StripHTML StripHTML can strip out HTML comments and specific tag attributes. SuperFences SuperFences is like Python Markdown's fences, but better. Nest fences under lists, admonitions, and other syntaxes. Combine multiple fences together in tabbed groups, and even create special custom fences for content like UML.

Coding Standards \ue157 When writing code, the code should roughly conform to PEP8 and PEP257 suggestions. The PyMdown Extensions project utilizes the Flake8 linter (with some additional plugins) to ensure code conforms (give or take some of the rules). When in doubt follow the formatting hints of existing code when adding or modifying files. existing files. Listed below are the modules used: pycqa/flake8 pycqa/flake8-docstrings pycqa/pep8-naming ebeweber/flake8-mutable gforcada/flake8-builtins Flake8 can be run directly via the command line from the root of the project. flake8 Building and Editing Documents \ue157 Documents are in Markdown (with with some additional syntax) and converted to HTML via Python Markdown and this extension bundle. If you would like to build and preview the documentation, you must have these packages installed: Python-Markdown/markdown : the Markdown parser. mkdocs/mkdocs : the document site generator. squidfunk/mkdocs-material : a material theme for MkDocs. facelessuser/pymdown-extensions : this Python Markdown extension bundle. In order to build and preview the documents, just run the command below from the root of the project and you should be able to view the documents at localhost:8000 in your browser. After that, you should be able to update the documents and have your browser preview update live. mkdocs serve Editing Document Theme \ue157 It isn't expected that people will need to mess with the theme, but if it is needed, a little additional work is required. The documents use the Material theme for MkDocs with some additional local tweaks and additions. JavaScript additions are provided in docs/src/js and are in es2015 syntax and are converted to es5. Stylesheets are located at docs/src/scss and are written in SCSS, and are converted to CSS. All conversions are done in a Node.js environment. In order to get up and running, download and install Yarn . Also, install Node.js version 6+. From the root of the project, in a terminal, enter the command below. This command will install all the needed Node.js modules. yarn install After that you can begin making changes. When ready, you can run the following commands to get a live preview while you make edits, lint your changes, or build the final output. Yarn Commands Description yarn serve Create a live preview at localhost:8000 that will pick up your changes as you make them. yarn build Build the final output which will package, minimize, and revision the scripts and stylesheets. It will also update the mkdocs.yml file to point to the new revisioned files. yarn lint Run just lint on the files. yarn clean_all This will clean out the generated CSS and JavaScript files. It will also cleanup the generated MkDocs' site. If you need to make changes to the mkdocs.yml file, do not update the one in project root directly, but update the one in docs/src . The build environment copies the one in docs/src to the project root and injects the revisioned script name(s) and stylesheet name(s). When serving via yarn , if you want to make sure that the local version of pymdown-extensions is used, you need to configure yarn serve to call with Python instead of calling the MkDocs binary: yarn serve --mkdocs=\"python3 -m mkdocs\" . This is because if you are calling Python, it will look in the current working directory first for a given module when importing, but if you call the MkDocs binary, it will instead import the installed pymdown-extensions . Configuring the --mkdocs option is also useful if mkdocs is not in your path, or you want to call with a specific version of Python. Spell Checking Documents \ue157 During validation we build the docs and run a spell checker on them. The spell checker script uses Aspell . Currently this project uses the latest Aspell. As the latest Aspell is not available on Windows, it is not expected that everyone will install and run Aspell locally. In order to perform the spell check, it is expected you are setup to build the documents, and that you have Aspell installed in the your system path. To initiate the spell check run the following command from the root of the project: python tests/spelling.py It should print out the files with the misspelled words if any are found. If you find it prints words that are not misspelled, you can add them in .dictionary in the root of the project. Validation Tests \ue157 In order to preserve good code health, a test suite has been put together with pytest ( pytest-dev/pytest ). There are currently two kinds of tests: syntax and targeted. To run these tests, you can use the following command: python run_tests.py Syntax \ue157 Syntax tests are essentially text files containing Markdown. They are found under tests/extensions . test_syntax.py scans all the files and converts the files to HTML with the extensions and options defined in tests/extensions/tests.yml . They are then compared to the current stored HTML output. If the two differ, the test fails. To run only these tests, from the root of the project run the following command: python run_tests.py --test-target syntax You could also run them directly with: py.test tests/test_syntax.py To run a specific syntax test: python run_tests.py --test-target syntax --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt To accept the differences in tests due to a change(s) you made, you can run the following command: python run_tests.py --update To update and accept the differences in a single test: python run_tests.py --update --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt Targeted \ue157 Targeted tests are unit tests that target specific areas in the code and exercises them to ensure proper functionality. These tests are found in test_targeted.py . You can run only these tests from the root of the project with: python run_tests.py --test-target targeted You could also run them directly with: py.test tests/test_targeted.py Running Validation With Tox \ue157 Tox ( tox-dev/tox ) is a great way to run the validation tests, spelling checks, and linting in virtual environments so as not to mess with your current working environment. Tox will use the specified Python version for the given environment and create a virtual environment and install all the needed requirements (minus Aspell). You could also setup your own virtual environments with the Virtualenv module without Tox, and manually do the same. First, you need to have Tox installed: pip install tox By running Tox, it will walk through all the environments and create them (assuming you have all the python versions on your machine) and run the related tests. See tox.ini to learn more. tox If you don't have all the Python versions needed to test all the environments, those entries will fail. You can ignore those. Spelling will also fail if you don't have the correct version of Aspell. To target a specific environment to test, you use the -e option to select the environment of interest. To select lint: tox -elint To select PY27 unit tests (or other versions \u2013 change accordingly): tox -epy27-unittests To select spelling and document building: tox -edocuments Code Coverage \ue157 When running the validation tests through Tox, it is setup to track code coverage via the Coverage ( ned/coveragepy ) module. Coverage is run on each pyxx-unittests environment. If you've made changes to the code, you can clear the old coverage data: coverage erase Then run each unit test environment to and coverage will be calculated. All the data from each run is merged together. HTML is output for each file in .tox/pyXX-unittests/tmp . You can use these to see areas that are not covered/exercised yet with testing. You can checkout tox.ini to see how this is accomplished. Generating Emoji Indexes \ue157 The Emoji extension has emoji indexes generated from the source of Gemoji, EmojiOne, and Twemoji. Below is the process for auto-generating these indexes. In the case of Twemoji, it will also reference EmojiOne's short name index, so you may need to do both EmojiOne and Twemoji if the support is not satisfactory. Ensure you have Requests ( requests/requests ) installed: pip install requests . Fork the repository and checkout to your machine. Navigate to the root of the project. Call the generator script: python tools/gen_emoji.py --gemoji , python tools/gen_emoji.py --emojione , or python tools/gen_emoji.py --twemoji . If you already have the latest tag locally, you can specify --no-download . It will prompt you to select a tag to download and/or use. Please pull the latest official tag. Please don't pull experimental tags. This should update the indexes. Then you want to update the tests. Force the tests to update via python run_tests.py --update . Make sure only the emoji tests get updated. Nothing is fool proof. If they make a breaking change to the files that the script parses, or the location of the files change, the auto-update tool may need to be updated itself (hopefully this would be a rare occurrence). If such a change does occur, and you are feeling brave, a pull request would be appreciated, but in time, they will be resolved regardless.","title":"Development"},{"location":"development/#development","text":"","title":"Development"},{"location":"development/#project-layout","text":"There are a number of files for build, test, and continuous integration in the root of the project, but in general, the project is broken up like so. \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs \u251c\u2500\u2500 pymdownx \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements \u251c\u2500\u2500 tests \u2514\u2500\u2500 tools Directory Description docs This contains the source files for the documentation. pymdownx This contains the source code for all the extensions. requirements This contains files with lists of dependencies required dependencies for continuous integration. tests This contains the various tests that are run in order to ensure code health. tools This contains various tools that are necessary during development.","title":"Project Layout"},{"location":"development/#coding-standards","text":"When writing code, the code should roughly conform to PEP8 and PEP257 suggestions.

If you prefer to use something other than MathJax, Arithmatex can output a more generic format suitable for other libraries like KaTeX . Arithmatex searches for the patterns $ ... $ and \\( ... \\) for inline math, and $$ ... $$ , \\[ ... \\] , and \\begin {} ... \\end {} for block math. By default, all formats are enabled, but each format can individually be disabled if desired. Input Format \ue157 By default, smart_dollar mode is enabled for the $ ... $ inline variant. With smart_dollar it is expected that the opening token ( $ ) is to be followed by a non-whitespace character, and the closing to be preceded by a non-white-space character. This is to help avoid false positives when using the dollar sign in traditional ways such as: I have $2.00 and Bob has $10.00. The previous statement requires no escaping of the $ character. But when needed, the $ character can be escaped using \\$ . smart_dollar can be disabled and will capture any $ ... $ whose dollar symbols are not escaped ( \\$ ). Inline Examples $ p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } $ , \\( p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } \\) . p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} , p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} . Tip When using MathJax, for best results, it is advised to not use generic mode, and configure MathJax without the text2jax extension since MathJax automatically detects Arithmatex's default output. If using generic mode (for libraries like KaTeX), Arithmatex will convert dollars to the form \\( ... \\) in the HTML output. This is because $ ... $ is extremely problematic to scan for, which is why MathJax and KaTeX disable $ ... $ by default in their plain text scanners, and why Arithmatex enables smart_dollar by default when scanning for $ ... $ . It is advised, if outputting in in generic mode, to not configure your JavaScript library to look for $ ... $ and instead look for \\( ... \\) , and let Arithmatex's handle $ ... $ . For block forms, the block must start with the appropriate opening for the block type: $$ , \\[ , and \\begin {} for the respective search pattern. The block must also end with the proper respective end: $$ , \\] , and \\end {} . A block also must contain no empty lines and should be both preceded and followed by an empty line. Block Examples $$ E ( \\mathbf {v}, \\mathbf {h} ) = - \\sum _{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum _i b_i v_i - \\sum _j c_j h_j $$ \\[ 3 < 4 \\] \\begin { align } p(v _ i=1| \\mathbf { h } ) & = \\sigma\\left ( \\sum _ j w _{ ij } h _ j + b _ i \\right ) \\\\ p(h _ j=1| \\mathbf { v } ) & = \\sigma\\left ( \\sum _ i w _{ ij } v _ i + c _ j \\right ) \\end { align } E(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{h}) = -\\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum_i b_i v_i - \\sum_j c_j h_j E(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{h}) = -\\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum_i b_i v_i - \\sum_j c_j h_j 3 < 4 3 < 4 \\begin{align} p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\ p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right) \\end{align} \\begin{align} p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\ p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right) \\end{align} MathJax Output Format \ue157 The math equations will be wrapped in a special MathJax script tag and embedded into the HTML. MathJax can already find these scripts, so there is no need to include and configure the tex2jax.js extension when setting up MathJax. The tag will be < script type = \"math/tex\" ></ script > for inline and < script type = \"math/tex; mode=display\" ></ script > for block. By default, Arithmatex will also generate a preview span with the class MathJax_Preview that MathJax will hide when the math content is actually loaded. If you do not want to see the preview, simply set preview to False . Generic Output Format \ue157 If generic is enabled, the extension will escape necessary symbols and normalize all output to be wrapped in the more reliable \\( ... \\) for inline math and \\[ ... \\] for display math (unless changed via tex_inline_wrap and tex_block_wrap in the options ). Lastly every everything is inserted into a span or div for inline and display math respectively. With the default settings, if in your Markdown you used $ ... $ for inline math, it would be converted to < span class = \"arithmatex\" > \\(...\\) </ span > in the HTML. Blocks would be normalized from $$ ... $$ to < div class = \"arithmatex\" > \\[...\\] </ div > . In the case of \\begin {} ... \\end {} , begins and ends will not be replaced, only wrapped: < div class = \"arithmatex\" > \\[\\begin{}...\\end{}\\] </ div > . Loading MathJax \ue157 Arithmatex requires you to provide the MathJax library and provide and configure it to your liking. The recommended way of including MathJax is to use the CDN. Latest version at time of writing this is found below. < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js\" ></ script > Generally, it is best to add your own configuration to get exactly what you want. Here we show some simple examples of configurations done in JavaScript. We've provided two basic configurations below: one that is configured for Arithmatex's MathJax Output Format , and one that works with the Generic Output Format by using tex2jax . These are a good starting point,so feel free to take them and configure them further. Please see the MathJax site for more info on using MathJax extensions/plugins and configuring those extensions/plugins. Default MathJax . Hub .

We also don't bother adding $ ... $ and $$ ... $$ to the inlineMath and displayMath options as Arithmatex converts them respectively to \\( ... \\) and \\[ ... \\] in the HTML output (unless altered in Options ). But we do have to enable processEnvironments to properly process \\begin {} ... \\end {} blocks. Loading KaTeX \ue157 In order to use KaTeX, the generic output format is required. You will need to include the KaTeX library: < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.9.0/katex.min.js\" ></ script > And the KaTeX CSS: < link rel = \"stylesheet\" type = \"text/css\" href = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.9.0/katex.min.css\" > Though KaTeX does have its own auto load script, we want to ensure it only loads math content from elements with the arithmatex class. Below is a script that would do just that. Notice we check for and strip wrappers \\( ... \\) and \\[ ... \\] off the content of the elements and send it through the renderer. We also don't bother adding $ ... $ and $$ ... $$ to the inlineMath and displayMath options as Arithmatex converts them respectively to \\( ... \\) and \\[ ... \\] in the HTML output (unless altered in Options ).

Arithmatex provides a number of compatible formats that can be used in conjunction with InlineHilite and SuperFences to create an alternative (and possibly more preferable) syntax for math. In InlineHilite, by simply providing the following configuration (no need to include pymdownx.arithmatex as an extension), you can create a familiar inline math format: import pymdownx.arithmatex as arithmatex extensions = [ \"pymdownx.inlinehilite\" ] extension_config = { \"pymdownx.inlinehilite\" : { \"custom_inline\" : [ { \"name\" : \"math\" , \"class\" : \"arithmatex\" , arithmatex . inline_mathjax_format } ] } } Inline Math `#!math p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}` p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} In SuperFences, by providing the following configuration (no need to include pymdownx.arithmatex as an extension), you can create math fences: import pymdownx.arithmatex as arithmatex extensions = [ \"pymdownx.inlinehilite\" ] extension_config = { \"pymdownx.superfences\" : { \"custom_fences\" : [ { \"name\" : \"math\" , \"class\" : \"arithmatex\" , arithmatex . inline_mathjax_format } ] } } Math Fences ```math \\begin{align} p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\ p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right) \\end{align} ``` \\begin{align} p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) &amp; = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\ p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) &amp; = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right) \\end{align} Provided formats are found below: Name Description inline_mathjax_preview_format Inline format suitable for InlineHilite that preserves math in MathJax script format with an appropriate preview. inline_mathjax_format Inline format suitable for InlineHilite that preserves math in MathJax script format without a preview. inline_generic_format Inline format suitable for InlineHilite that preserves math in generic spans with arithmatex class.

But when needed, the $ character can be escaped using \\$ . smart_dollar can be disabled and will capture any $ ... $ whose dollar symbols are not escaped ( \\$ ). Inline Examples $ p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } $ , \\( p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } \\) . p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} , p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} . Tip When using MathJax, for best results, it is advised to not use generic mode, and configure MathJax without the text2jax extension since MathJax automatically detects Arithmatex's default output.

This is because $ ... $ is extremely problematic to scan for, which is why MathJax and KaTeX disable $ ... $ by default in their plain text scanners, and why Arithmatex enables smart_dollar by default when scanning for $ ... $ .

It provides two modes that control both asterisk's and underscore's bold and italic syntax: smart when smart_enable is turned on and normal if smart_enable is turned off. BetterEm overrides all the current bold and italic rules in Python Markdown with its own. When smart is enabled for either asterisks and/or underscores, it is enabled for all variants: single and double. When smart is enabled, the behavior will be very similar in feel to GFM bold and italic (but not necessarily exact). Reminder Remember to read the Usage Notes for information that may be relevant when using this extension! Differences \ue157 Note For all examples on this page, underscores are smart and asterisks are not. BetterEm requires that non-whitespace characters follow the opening token(s) and precede the closing token(s). Whitespace Example * Won't highlight * *Will highlight* This * won't emphasize * This will emphasize BetterEm allows for a more natural nested token feel. Nested Token Example ***I'm italic and bold* I am just bold.** ***I'm bold and italic!** I am just italic.* I'm italic and bold I am just bold. I'm bold and italic! I am just italic. BetterEm will ensure smart mode doesn't terminate in scenarios where there are a large amount of consecutive tokens inside. Consecutive Token Example ___A lot of underscores____________is okay___ ___A lot of underscores____________is okay___ A lot of underscores____________is okay A lot of underscores____________is okay BetterEm will also ensure that smart mode breaks proper when an inner like token signifies an end. Smart Break Example __This will all be bold __because of the placement of the center underscores.__ __This will all be bold __ because of the placement of the center underscores.__ __This will NOT all be bold__ because of the placement of the center underscores.__ __This will all be bold_ because of the token is less than that of the surrounding.__ This will all be bold __because of the placement of the center underscores. This will all be bold __ because of the placement of the center asterisks.

You can also highlight specific text with {==highlight me==} . Or even comment, which is generally done by highlighting text and following it with a comment: {==highlight me==}{>>Add a comment<<} .

If you need to reject critic marks or accept them, the Critic extension will work quite well. But when trying to render the edits visually and trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly. I think this is the one unfortunate problem with CriticMarkup. The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source. Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created for the preview (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax). I think Fletcher said it best here: http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/criticmarkup . The Critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some of the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix). It injects some classes into the edit region's HTML output which allows for CSS styling. There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but whether this extension will be going further down that road has not yet been decided. CSS \ue157 Critic renders the CriticMarkup with the following classes. Classes Description critic This is applied to all critic edits. break This is applied to critic inserts or deletes that encompass only 2+ newlines. block Applied to critic HTML tags that are detected as surrounding a block region. comment A CriticMarkup comment.

Use ??? to start a details block or ???+ if you want to start a details block whose default state is 'open'. Follow the start of the block with an optional class or classes (separated with spaces) and the summary contained in quotes. Content is placed below the header and must be indented. ??? optional-class \"Summary\" Here's some content. ??? multiple optional-class \"Summary\" Here's some content. Example Details ???+ note \"Open styled details\" ??? danger \"Nested details!\" And more content again. Open styled details Nested details! And more content again. It is also possible to provide only a class. If this is done, the title will be derived from the first class. Example Class from Title ??? success Content. Success Content. ??? warning classes Content. Warning Content. Details will be output in the format below. The content will always be encapsulated in tags of some kind. < details class = \"optional-class\" >< summary > Text </ summary >< p > Content </ p ></ details > Browser Support \ue157 Unfortunately, due to how new < details >< summary > tags are, not all browsers support them yet. In order to have them supported in all new browsers, you will have to provide some fallback styling and JavaScript until all browsers catch up. This extension's goal is not to provide you with the perfect polyfill, but this is a basic example that provides basic support. There are more elaborate polyfills available that support jQuery, add keyboard events, or even support back to IE8. Feel free to modify what is here or find a solution that fits your needs. Basic Polyfill Setup Here is the basic CSS that that can be used. It is meant to provide a consistent CSS in both browsers that support < details >< summary > tags and those that do not. details { display : block ; } details [ open ] > summary :: before { content : \"\\25BC\" ; } details summary { display : block ; cursor : pointer ; } details summary : focus { outline : none ; } details summary :: before { content : \"\\25B6\" ; padding-right : 0.5 em ; } details summary :: -webkit-details-marker { display : none ; } /* Attach the \"no-details\" class to details tags in browsers that do not support them to get open/show functionality. */ details . no-details : not ([ open ]) > * { display : none ; } details . no-details : not ([ open ]) summary { display : block ; } And below is the JavaScript that will detect browsers that do not support < details >< summary > tags and apply a no-details class to all details in those browsers. It will also attach a click event that will toggle the open state. The CSS above will target the no-details class and the open attribute to hide/show the content of your < details > tag. Just run the code after the HTML content is loaded. There are plenty of things that aren't covered here, like jumping to a footnote or ID inside a closed polyfilled detail element, but this is left up to the user to figure out, or for a complete 3 rd party polyfill.

In order to have them supported in all new browsers, you will have to provide some fallback styling and JavaScript until all browsers catch up. This extension's goal is not to provide you with the perfect polyfill, but this is a basic example that provides basic support. There are more elaborate polyfills available that support jQuery, add keyboard events, or even support back to IE8. Feel free to modify what is here or find a solution that fits your needs. Basic Polyfill Setup Here is the basic CSS that that can be used. It is meant to provide a consistent CSS in both browsers that support < details >< summary > tags and those that do not. details { display : block ; } details [ open ] > summary :: before { content : \"\\25BC\" ; } details summary { display : block ; cursor : pointer ; } details summary : focus { outline : none ; } details summary :: before { content : \"\\25B6\" ; padding-right : 0.5 em ; } details summary :: -webkit-details-marker { display : none ; } /* Attach the \"no-details\" class to details tags in browsers that do not support them to get open/show functionality. */ details . no-details : not ([ open ]) > * { display : none ; } details . no-details : not ([ open ]) summary { display : block ; } And below is the JavaScript that will detect browsers that do not support < details >< summary > tags and apply a no-details class to all details in those browsers. It will also attach a click event that will toggle the open state. The CSS above will target the no-details class and the open attribute to hide/show the content of your < details > tag. Just run the code after the HTML content is loaded. There are plenty of things that aren't covered here, like jumping to a footnote or ID inside a closed polyfilled detail element, but this is left up to the user to figure out, or for a complete 3 rd party polyfill.

This is accomplished by using a short name index to map easy to remember names to associated Unicode data. The Unicode data is then converted into actual Unicode emoji characters and/or special HTML elements (usually images) that represent the emoji. Emoji Example :smile: :heart: :thumbsup: Supported Emoji Providers \ue157 There are a number of emoji short name conventions that people may be aware of. These conventions are always tied to a specific emoji set. These conventions differ because there is no official Unicode short name convention. At the present, Emoji chooses to focus on three specific emoji sets: Gemoji ( ): Gemoji is GitHub's open source emoji solution. It contains a lot of common emoji and a couple special, non Unicode emoji (like Gemoji's :octocat: ). If you are a GitHub user, you are probably familiar with some of the short names associated with it. Their associated CDN contains the emoji in 75x75 PNG format. EmojiOne ( ): EmojiOne is a very complete, high quality emoji set with support for gender and skin tone modifiers. Their free emoji set includes PNGs in sizes of 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 which are all available via a CDN. Their older (version 2.2.7) emoji set, which contains less emoji, offers SVG images as well. Emoji supports EmojiOne's newest short name mapping, but it can be used for their older set, but short names for emoji that have been added since the old set will not map to any images if this is done. Twemoji ( ): Twemoji is Twitter's open source emoji set which also covers a great many emoji with skin tones and gender modifiers. The hosted CDN provides 72x72 PNG emoji or SVG emoji. While Gemoji and EmojiOne have a short name convention, Twemoji does not, and there are currently no 3 rd projects that provide short names anywhere close to all the provided emoji. Since EmojiOne has the largest emoji library of the supported sets, we use EmojiOne's short name list for Twemoji. There will be a reasonable attempt to patch in emoji not found in EmojiOne's index, but if EmojiOne is ever significantly behind, we may wait for EmojiOne to catch up. Emoji Image Licensing PyMdown Extensions has no affiliation with EmojiOne, Gemoji, or Twemoji. The indexes generated from their sources are covered under their respective licensing. When using their images or CSS, please see their licensing terms to ensure proper usage and attributions. EmojiOne: https://www.emojione.com/developers/free-license Gemoji: https://github.com/github/gemoji/blob/master/LICENSE Twemoji: https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE-GRAPHICS All short name indexes that Emoji uses are generated from EmojiOne's or Gemoji's latest official source tag \u2013 Twemoji uses EmojiOne's index as the Twemoji repository does not ship with a short name index. The indexes contain the emoji names, short names, values, etc.; everything needed to insert Unicode emoji characters or specially crafted HTML elements. Emoji Output Formats \ue157 Depending on your needs, you may have different requirements for how emoji get displayed in your documents. You may want to use PNG images, or maybe you really like SVG images. Maybe you just want to convert short names to the actual Unicode code points. There are a variety of ways you may want to output emoji, and the Emoji extension has you covered. Emoji provides various output formats that take the Unicode data associated with a short name (or the short name itself in the case of a custom emoji) and generates an HTML output. Not all of the provided output formats will work for each emoji index, but there are a few that should work for all three. Check out Default Emoji Generators or Custom Emoji Generators to learn more. Default Emoji Indexes \ue157 By default, Emoji provides three indexes: emojione , gemoji , and twemoji . All indexes are generated from the most recent official release tag source (in the case of Twemoji, sort names are acquired from EmojiOne's generated index). They can be used by passing in one of the three functions below via the emoji_index parameter. Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out Custom Emoji Indexes . Tip If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. pymdownx.emoji.emojione This is the default function that is used, and it provides an index using the latest EmojiOne supported emoji (at the time of release). You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following: >>> import pymdownx.emoji1_db as e1db >>> e1db . version '4.0.0' EmojiOne Update EmojiOne 3.0+ releases dropped fee SVG support. PNG support can still be obtained via CDNs. While EmojiOne only offers 3.0+ vector graphics to paying customers now, you can still get SVG support. By default, we still use 2.2.7 SVGs, but you won't get images for emoji added after 2.2.7. If using SVG sprites, you will have to download the sprite SVG. Twemoji actually offers SVG support, so if you really need (or prefer) SVG support, you can try Twemoji. pymdownx.emoji.gemoji This function provides an index of the latest Gemoji supported emoji (at the time of release). You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following: >>> import pymdownx.gemoji_db as gmdb >>> gmdb . version 'v3.0.0' pymdownx.emoji.twemoji This function provides an index of the latest Twemoji supported emoji (at the time of release). The associated short names are currently borrowed from EmojiOne's index. There are a few emoji that are currently Twemoji specific, two of which are likely to always be as they are not part of the official emoji spec. The short names are listed below. Twemoji Specific Emoji Twemoji provides some non-standard emoji. We've made them available following the naming patterns that EmojiOne follows as we are using their short name index. The emoji are either some that only Twemoji supports, rarely supported by others, or emoji that have tone and/or gender modifiers that aren't supported in the Unicode specifications. We've also provided appropriate aliases for consistency with other like emoji. :pirate_flag: :shibuya: :skier_tone1: :skier_tone2: :skier_tone3: :skier_tone4: :skier_tone5: :woman_levitate: :woman_levitate_tone1: :woman_levitate_tone2: :woman_levitate_tone3: :woman_levitate_tone4: :woman_levitate_tone5: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone1: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone2: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone3: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone4: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone5: :woman_in_tuxedo: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone1: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone2: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone3: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone4: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone5: You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following: >>> import pymdownx.twemoji_db as twdb >>> twdb . version 'v11.2.0' Default Emoji Generators \ue157 Emoji provides six default emoji generators. PNG output and Unicode code point output are supported for all three indexes. SVG output is only supported for Twemoji and the older 2.2.7 EmojiOne set. PNG sprites and the \"Font Awesome\" like format are only supported by EmojiOne. SVG sprites is only supported by the 2.2.7 EmojiOne. You can select a generator to use by passing in one of the functions below via the emoji_generator parameter. Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out Custom Emoji Generators . Tip If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. pymdownx.emoji.to_png This is a general purpose generator which provides EmojiOne, GitHub, and Twemoji CDN path(s) out of the box. Depending on the index you've chosen, you the appropriate CDN will be provided. If this ever gets out of date, a new CDN can be passed in via image_path and/or non_standard_image_path . EmojiOne actually has multiple PNGs sizes of 32, 64, and 128, but the default CDN path is the one for size 64: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/4.0/png/64/ . You can change it for a larger or smaller PNG size by updating the size in the URL and passing the new URL in through image_path . The PNG output form is as follows: < img alt = \"\ud83d\ude04\" class = \"emojione\" src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/4.0/png/64/1f604.png\" title = \":smile:\" /> Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Specifies the class(es) to be used in the image element. image_path string CDN for the default index used This can be either a local path or a CDN containing the assets. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne, Gemoji, and Twemoji depending on which index is being used. non_standard_image_path string CDN for the default index used This can be either a local path, or a CDN containing the assets. Currently, only Gemoji's non-standard emoji take advantage of this as the GitHub CDN alters the path slightly for its non-Unicode emoji. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for Gemoji. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_svg This generator was written to output SVG images and supports EmojiOne and Twemoji. EmojiOne's SVG support is only for the free 2.2.7 release, so the default CDN still references the 2.2.7 release. EmojiOne short names added after 2.2.7 will not find images. You can of course reference local SVG images as well by pointing image_path to them as well. The SVG image outputs as: < img alt = \"\ud83d\ude04\" class = \"emojione\" src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/1f604.svg\" title = \":smile:\" /> Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Specifies the class(es) to be used in the image element. The default will match the name of the index used. image_path string A CDN for EmojiOne images This can be either a local path or a CDN containing the assets. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_png_sprite This generator was written to support PNG sprite output for EmojiOne. It is expected that this will be used in conjunction with the the official EmojiOne CSS. You can include the CSS from the CDN in your document. The CSS comes in three sizes: 32, 64, 128. Make sure to set the correct size in the options to generate the appropriate classes. Example CDN for the 4.0 version with 64px PNGs: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/4.0/sprites/emojione-sprite-64.min.css . to_png_sprite outputs the emoji as a span in the form below. The CSS will apply the appropriate mapping in the sprite PNG to the background image of the span. < span class = \"emojione-64-people _1f604\" title = \":smile:\" > \ud83d\ude04 </ span > Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Class(es) used for the span where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: ' %(class)s - %(size)s - %(category)s _ %(unicode)s ' . size int 64 Integer specifying the size for the class above. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_svg_sprite This was written to support EmojiOne SVG sprite output. The output form was taken directly from an example in the EmojiOne source. It is expected that the the user will provide a local version of the official SVG sprite and the path to it. Unfortunately there is no free 3.0 SVG sprite, so you will need to download the old 2.27 one. The output is: < svg class = \"emojione\" >< description > \ud83d\ude04 </ description >< use xlink:href = \"./../assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.svg#emoji-1f604\" ></ use ></ svg > Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Class(es) to apply to the svg element where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: ' %(class)s - %(unicode)s ' . image_path string '' Path to the SVG sprites. pymdownx.emoji.to_awesome This generator is another EmojiOne specific output called EmojiOne Awesome. It aims to give a font-awesome like interface for EmojiOne. The emojione-awesome CDN currently follows this format: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emojione@4.0.0/extras/css/emojione-awesome.css , so update accordingly. The output format is: < i class = \"e1a-smile\" ></ i > Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string 'e1a' Class(es) to apply to the element where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: ' %(class)s - %(shortname)s ' . attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_alt This generator supports all emoji indexes. The generator outputs the alt value directly to the document. The output can be Unicode characters, HTML entities, or even just the short name depending on what the global setting of alt is set to. \ud83d\ude03 There are no generator specific options. Custom Emoji Indexes \ue157 In order to provide a custom index, the Emoji extension must be given a function that returns a suitable emoji index. No parameters are passed to the function. The function should simply return the custom index in the following format. emoji_index = { # Name is the name of the index. This is passed into the emoji # generator functions and can be used to differentiate logic # for different indexes if required. \"name\" : \"myindex\" , # The actual index. A dictionary of all the emoji. # Different emoji short names with the same Unicode data # can be mentioned under aliases. \"emoji\" : { # Key is the short name. \":zero:\" : { # Name is the long name. \"name\" : \"keycap digit zero\" , # Category of emoji. # Not needed if this is a non-Unicode, custom # emoji with no category \"category\" : \"symbol\" , # Unicode is the representation of the Unicode # code points, but it is not necessarily valid Unicode # code points. Essentially it is what represents the Unicode # and is used as the image name for pngs and svgs. Depending # on the index, it may not be code points alt all. It is also # sometimes used as part of special class names in the HTML # output (depending on the generator). # # In the case of Gemoji and EmojiOne this is the Unicode code # points with variations and joiners striped out. In the case of # Twemoji, it is usually full valid code points though leading # zeros are stripped from the beginning. # # Do not include this if the emoji is a custom, non-Unicode emoji. \"unicode\" : \"0030-20e3\" , # This is the full Unicode code points and is # used for the \"alt\" attributes in the HTML output of images. # It is redundant to include this if it is the # same as 'unicode', but it won't hurt anything if it is. # # Do not include this if the emoji is a custom, # non-Unicode emoji. This shows a fully qualified emoji code, # but it could just as easily be \"0030-2033\" which is also valid. # Some indexes will provide fully qualified, some may not. \"unicode_alt\" : \"0030-fe0f-20e3\" }, # No need to specify 'unicode_alt' as it is the same # as 'unicode'. \":thumbsup:\" : { \"name\" : \"thumbs up sign\" , \"unicode\" : \"1f44d\" , \"category\" : \"people\" }, # Should not specify any unicode fields # as this is not a real unicode emoji. \":octocat:\" : { \"name\" : \"octocat\" }, }, # Short names that share previously defined Unicode data # like '+1' and 'thumbsup' etc. \"aliases\" : { # Key is the alias. # Value is the short name it maps to in the # previously defined 'emoji' key. \":+1:\" : \":thumbsup:\" } } Custom Emoji Generators \ue157 Each different kind of output is controlled by a different emoji generator function, but all generator functions have the same input format. The format is shown below in case you need to create your own custom output generator. def emoji_generator ( index , shortname , alias , uc , alt , title , category , options , md ) Parameter Type Description index string The name of the selected emoji index. shortname string The current short name. This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name. alias string If the specified short name is an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under shortname . This will be None if the name used was not an alias. uc string This is a string representation of the Unicode, it could technically be anything as this is normally used to reference image files. So while some indexes will have this be code points, it may not contain code points at all or it may strip out code points for simpler image names. So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji. This will be None for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode. alt string This is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value). Its format will differ depending on the extension setting alt and also the index being used. This will be returned as either the full valid Unicode characters or HTML entities, or it will be the short name used. See the alt setting for more info. title string This is the title that can be used in image elements. Depending on the global extension setting title , this will either return the full long description, the short name, or None . See the title setting for more info. category string Category of the emoji, or None if there is no category for the emoji. options dictionary This is a dictionary to specify generator function specific options. This can be anything, and it is up to the generator function to parse and provide defaults. md class This is the Markdown class object. This is mainly used to access specific things needed from the Markdown class when formatting your output. If you needed to stash your output, you would do something like: md . htmlStash . store ( alt , safe = True ) . Non-Unicode emoji Keep in mind that Gemoji ships with some non-standard emoji like :octocat: that do not have Unicode code points. uc and alt are affected by this and will return None and the short name respectively instead of strings describing the Unicode points. For example :octocat: will just return None for uc and :octocat: for alt . If you are parsing an index with custom emoji, like Gemoji has, then you need to be aware of this. Using with MkDocs \ue157 This project uses these extensions with MkDocs to generate the documentation. It might not be obvious how to set the index or generator functions in MkDocs' YAML settings file, but it is actually pretty easy. The functions are referenced like you would import them in Python except you also append them with a special prefix to let the YAML module know that the setting value is a Python object. For instance, to specify the to_svg generator, you would simply reference it like this: !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg (or you could use your own custom module ). markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_generator : !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg Emoji Index Updates \ue157 The Emoji extension might at times be behind on having indexes built from the latest repositories. We try to keep the indexes updated with new releases, but if they fall out of date, you can open an issue on the this project's issue page to alert the maintainer(s) and they will update them when someone gets a chance. Pull requests are also welcome. The process for updating the indexes is automated, so it is fairly easy to do a pull request. See Generating Emoji Indexes for more info. Options \ue157 Option Type Default Description emoji_index function emojione index A function that returns the index to use when parsing :short_name: syntax. See Default Emoji Indexes to see the provided indexes. emoji_generator function to_png generator A function that takes the emoji info and constructs the desired emoji output. See Default Emoji Generators to see the provided generators. title string 'short' Specifies the title format that is fed into the emoji generator function. Can either be long which is the long description of the emoji, short which is the short name ( :short: ), or none which will simply pass None . alt string 'unicode' Specifies the format for the alt value that is passed to the emoji generator function. If alt is set to short , the short name will be passed to the generator. If alt is set to unicode the Unicode characters are passed to the generator. Lastly, if alt is set to html_entity , the Unicode characters are passed encoded as HTML entities. remove_variation_selector bool False Specifies whether variation selectors should be removed from Unicode alt. Currently, only fe0f is removed as it is the only one presently found in the current emoji sets. options dictionary {} Options that are specific to emoji generator functions. Supported parameters can vary from function to function. Legacy GitHubEmoji Emulation The Emoji extension was actually created to replace the now retired GitHubEmoji extension. Emoji was written to be much more flexible. If you have a desire to configure the output to be like the legacy GitHubEmoji extension, you can use the settings below. This shows the full setup.

We've also provided appropriate aliases for consistency with other like emoji. :pirate_flag: :shibuya: :skier_tone1: :skier_tone2: :skier_tone3: :skier_tone4: :skier_tone5: :woman_levitate: :woman_levitate_tone1: :woman_levitate_tone2: :woman_levitate_tone3: :woman_levitate_tone4: :woman_levitate_tone5: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone1: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone2: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone3: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone4: :woman_in_business_suit_levitating_tone5: :woman_in_tuxedo: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone1: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone2: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone3: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone4: :woman_in_tuxedo_tone5: You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following: >>> import pymdownx.twemoji_db as twdb >>> twdb . version 'v11.2.0'","title":"Default Emoji Indexes"},{"location":"extensions/emoji/#default-emoji-generators","text":"Emoji provides six default emoji generators. PNG output and Unicode code point output are supported for all three indexes. SVG output is only supported for Twemoji and the older 2.2.7 EmojiOne set. PNG sprites and the \"Font Awesome\" like format are only supported by EmojiOne. SVG sprites is only supported by the 2.2.7 EmojiOne. You can select a generator to use by passing in one of the functions below via the emoji_generator parameter. Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out Custom Emoji Generators . Tip If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. pymdownx.emoji.to_png This is a general purpose generator which provides EmojiOne, GitHub, and Twemoji CDN path(s) out of the box. Depending on the index you've chosen, you the appropriate CDN will be provided. If this ever gets out of date, a new CDN can be passed in via image_path and/or non_standard_image_path . EmojiOne actually has multiple PNGs sizes of 32, 64, and 128, but the default CDN path is the one for size 64: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/4.0/png/64/ . You can change it for a larger or smaller PNG size by updating the size in the URL and passing the new URL in through image_path . The PNG output form is as follows: < img alt = \"\ud83d\ude04\" class = \"emojione\" src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/4.0/png/64/1f604.png\" title = \":smile:\" /> Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Specifies the class(es) to be used in the image element. image_path string CDN for the default index used This can be either a local path or a CDN containing the assets. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne, Gemoji, and Twemoji depending on which index is being used. non_standard_image_path string CDN for the default index used This can be either a local path, or a CDN containing the assets. Currently, only Gemoji's non-standard emoji take advantage of this as the GitHub CDN alters the path slightly for its non-Unicode emoji. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for Gemoji. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_svg This generator was written to output SVG images and supports EmojiOne and Twemoji. EmojiOne's SVG support is only for the free 2.2.7 release, so the default CDN still references the 2.2.7 release. EmojiOne short names added after 2.2.7 will not find images. You can of course reference local SVG images as well by pointing image_path to them as well. The SVG image outputs as: < img alt = \"\ud83d\ude04\" class = \"emojione\" src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/1f604.svg\" title = \":smile:\" /> Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Specifies the class(es) to be used in the image element. The default will match the name of the index used. image_path string A CDN for EmojiOne images This can be either a local path or a CDN containing the assets. By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_png_sprite This generator was written to support PNG sprite output for EmojiOne. It is expected that this will be used in conjunction with the the official EmojiOne CSS. You can include the CSS from the CDN in your document. The CSS comes in three sizes: 32, 64, 128. Make sure to set the correct size in the options to generate the appropriate classes. Example CDN for the 4.0 version with 64px PNGs: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/4.0/sprites/emojione-sprite-64.min.css . to_png_sprite outputs the emoji as a span in the form below. The CSS will apply the appropriate mapping in the sprite PNG to the background image of the span. < span class = \"emojione-64-people _1f604\" title = \":smile:\" > \ud83d\ude04 </ span > Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Class(es) used for the span where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: ' %(class)s - %(size)s - %(category)s _ %(unicode)s ' . size int 64 Integer specifying the size for the class above. attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_svg_sprite This was written to support EmojiOne SVG sprite output. The output form was taken directly from an example in the EmojiOne source. It is expected that the the user will provide a local version of the official SVG sprite and the path to it. Unfortunately there is no free 3.0 SVG sprite, so you will need to download the old 2.27 one. The output is: < svg class = \"emojione\" >< description > \ud83d\ude04 </ description >< use xlink:href = \"./../assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.svg#emoji-1f604\" ></ use ></ svg > Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string Name of the index used Class(es) to apply to the svg element where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: ' %(class)s - %(unicode)s ' . image_path string '' Path to the SVG sprites. pymdownx.emoji.to_awesome This generator is another EmojiOne specific output called EmojiOne Awesome. It aims to give a font-awesome like interface for EmojiOne. The emojione-awesome CDN currently follows this format: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emojione@4.0.0/extras/css/emojione-awesome.css , so update accordingly. The output format is: < i class = \"e1a-smile\" ></ i > Generator Specific Options Option Type Default Description classes string 'e1a' Class(es) to apply to the element where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: ' %(class)s - %(shortname)s ' . attributes dictionary {} A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values. pymdownx.emoji.to_alt This generator supports all emoji indexes. The generator outputs the alt value directly to the document. The output can be Unicode characters, HTML entities, or even just the short name depending on what the global setting of alt is set to. \ud83d\ude03 There are no generator specific options.","title":"Default Emoji Generators"},{"location":"extensions/emoji/#custom-emoji-indexes","text":"In order to provide a custom index, the Emoji extension must be given a function that returns a suitable emoji index.

This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name. alias string If the specified short name is an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under shortname . This will be None if the name used was not an alias. uc string This is a string representation of the Unicode, it could technically be anything as this is normally used to reference image files. So while some indexes will have this be code points, it may not contain code points at all or it may strip out code points for simpler image names. So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji. This will be None for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode. alt string This is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value). Its format will differ depending on the extension setting alt and also the index being used. This will be returned as either the full valid Unicode characters or HTML entities, or it will be the short name used. See the alt setting for more info. title string This is the title that can be used in image elements.

Its purpose is to provide a single place to configure syntax highlighting for code blocks. Both InlineHilite and SuperFences can use Highlight to configure their highlight settings, but highlight will also run all non-fence code blocks through the highlighter as well. The Highlight extension is inspired by CodeHilite , but differs in features. PyMdown Extensions chooses not to implement special language headers for standard Markdown code blocks like CodeHilite does; PyMdown Extensions takes the position that language headers are better suited in fenced code blocks. So standard Markdown code blocks will just be styled as plain text unless guess_language is enabled. If you wish to highlight lines and define line numbers per code block, it is advised to use the SuperFences extension. Highlight also provides a feature CodeHilite doesn't, and that is the ability to configure Pygments lexer options by either overriding the language with additional options, or creating an alternate language name with your desired options. As previously mentioned, both InlineHilite's and SuperFences' highlighting can be controlled by Highlight. Both can use Pygments or JavaScript highlighters to do their code syntax highlighting, but all of the settings here only affect highlighting via Pygments except use_pygments and css_class . If you want to use a JavaScript syntax highlighter, set use_pygments to False or make sure you don't have Pygments installed. Syntax Highlighting \ue157 If Pygments is installed, it will be the default syntax highlighter, but if it is not, or if use_pygments is turned off, code tags will be rendered in the HTML5 format for JavaScript highlighting: < pre class = \"highlight\" >< code class = \"language-mylanguage\" ></ code ></ pre > Extended Pygments Lexer Options \ue157 If using Pygments, some lexers have special options. For instance, the php lexer has the option startinline which, if enabled, will parse PHP syntax without requiring <? at the beginning. InlineHilite takes the approach of allowing you to create a special Pygments language with options. So if you wanted to enable startinline for php , you might create a language name called php-inline that maps to php with startinline enabled. This is done via the extend_pygments_lang option. extend_pygments_lang is an option that takes an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains three keys: name which is the new name you are adding, lang which is the language the new name maps to, and options which is a dictionary of the options you wish to apply. Highlight Example To create the above mentioned php-inline we would feed in the following to extend_pygments_lang : extended_pygments_lang = [ { \"name\" : \"php-inline\" , \"lang\" : \"php\" , \"options\" : { \"startinline\" : True }} ] Now we can do this: `#!php-inline $a = array(\"foo\" => 0, \"bar\" => 1);` To get this: $a = array ( \"foo\" => 0 , \"bar\" => 1 ); Line Number Styles \ue157 Pygments has two available styles when outputting source code with line numbers enabled: table and inline . table is the default output and creates a table output for lines with numbers. inline places the line numbers directly in the source code output and can sometimes be undesirable as it copy and paste will always copy the line numbers as well. The Highlight extension provides a third line number style called pymdownx-inline . Instead of writing line numbers directly in the pre like Pygments' default inline style does, it writes the line numbers as < span class = \"lineno\" data-linenos = \"1 \" ></ span > . This way the line numbers are un-selectable and can be displayed with CSS: [ data-linenos ] : before { content : attr ( data - linenos ); } Line number styles are set with the option linenums_style as described in Options . Options \ue157 Option Type Default Description css_class string 'highlight Default class to apply to the wrapper element on code blocks. Other extensions can override this. guess_lang bool False Guess what syntax language should be used if no language is specified. pygments_style string 'default' Set the Pygments' style to use. This really only has an effect when used with noclasses . noclasses bool False This will cause the styles to directly be written to the tag's style attribute instead of requiring a stylesheet. use_pygments bool True Controls whether Pygments (if available) is used to style the code, or if the code will just be escaped and prepped for a JavaScript syntax highlighter. linenums bool False Enable line numbers globally for block code. This will be ignored for inline code. linenums_special int 1 Globally sets the specified nth lines' gutter with the class \"special\". This can be overridden in SuperFences per fence if desired. linenums_style string 'table' Controls the output style when linenums are enabled. Supported styles are Pygments default table and inline , but also supported is the pymdown-extensions pymdownx-inline which provides a special inline mode, see Line Number Styles for more info. extend_pygments_lang list [] A list of extended languages to add.

If you want to use a JavaScript syntax highlighter, set use_pygments to False or make sure you don't have Pygments installed.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"extensions/highlight/#syntax-highlighting","text":"If Pygments is installed, it will be the default syntax highlighter, but if it is not, or if use_pygments is turned off, code tags will be rendered in the HTML5 format for JavaScript highlighting: < pre class = \"highlight\" >< code class = \"language-mylanguage\" ></ code ></ pre >","title":"Syntax Highlighting"},{"location":"extensions/highlight/#extended-pygments-lexer-options","text":"If using Pygments, some lexers have special options. For instance, the php lexer has the option startinline which, if enabled, will parse PHP syntax without requiring <? at the beginning. InlineHilite takes the approach of allowing you to create a special Pygments language with options. So if you wanted to enable startinline for php , you might create a language name called php-inline that maps to php with startinline enabled. This is done via the extend_pygments_lang option. extend_pygments_lang is an option that takes an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains three keys: name which is the new name you are adding, lang which is the language the new name maps to, and options which is a dictionary of the options you wish to apply. Highlight Example To create the above mentioned php-inline we would feed in the following to extend_pygments_lang : extended_pygments_lang = [ { \"name\" : \"php-inline\" , \"lang\" : \"php\" , \"options\" : { \"startinline\" : True }} ] Now we can do this: `#!php-inline $a = array(\"foo\" => 0, \"bar\" => 1);` To get this: $a = array ( \"foo\" => 0 , \"bar\" => 1 );","title":"Extended Pygments Lexer Options"},{"location":"extensions/highlight/#line-number-styles","text":"Pygments has two available styles when outputting source code with line numbers enabled: table and inline . table is the default output and creates a table output for lines with numbers. inline places the line numbers directly in the source code output and can sometimes be undesirable as it copy and paste will always copy the line numbers as well. The Highlight extension provides a third line number style called pymdownx-inline . Instead of writing line numbers directly in the pre like Pygments' default inline style does, it writes the line numbers as < span class = \"lineno\" data-linenos = \"1 \" ></ span > . This way the line numbers are un-selectable and can be displayed with CSS: [ data-linenos ] : before { content : attr ( data - linenos ); } Line number styles are set with the option linenums_style as described in Options .","title":"Line Number Styles"},{"location":"extensions/highlight/#options","text":"Option Type Default Description css_class string 'highlight Default class to apply to the wrapper element on code blocks.

This will be ignored for inline code. linenums_special int 1 Globally sets the specified nth lines' gutter with the class \"special\". This can be overridden in SuperFences per fence if desired. linenums_style string 'table' Controls the output style when linenums are enabled.

Borrowing from CodeHilite's existing syntax, InlineHilite utilizes the following syntax to insert inline highlighted code: `:::language mycode` or `#!language mycode` . In CodeHilite, #! means \"use line numbers\", but line numbers will never be used in inline code regardless of which form is used. Use of one form or the other is purely for personal preference. As this feature is discussed further, we will call these specifiers ( #! and ::: ) mock shebangs. Inline Highlighted Code Example Here is some code: `#!js function pad(v){return ('0'+v).split('').reverse().splice(0,2).reverse().join('')}`. The mock shebang will be treated like text here: ` #!js var test = 0; `. Here is some code: function pad ( v ){ return ( '0' + v ). split ( '' ). reverse (). splice ( 0 , 2 ). reverse (). join ( '' )} The mock shebang will be treated like text here: #!js var test = 0; . When using the colon mock shebang, 3 or more colons can be used. Mock shebangs must come immediately after the opening backtick(s) and must be followed by at least one space. If you need to escape a mock shebang at the start of a code block, just put a space before it and it will be treated as part of the code. Code Highlighting \ue157 Assuming Pygments is installed, code highlighting will be handled by Pygments by default. If Pygments is not installed, or disabled, code blocks will be output for JavaScript syntax highlighters as < code class = \"highlight language-mylanguage\" ></ code > . Highlighting can be further controlled if either the pymdownx.highlight extension is used or if Python Markdown's CodeHilite is used. If CodeHilite is configured, it's settings will be used to configure highlighting, but CodeHilite support is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. It is recommended to instead use pymdownx.highlight extension. If pymdownx.highlight is included and configured, CodeHilite will be ignored. Using JavaScript Highlighters \ue157 If using Pygments , the elements will be highlighted without issues, but you may need to adjust CSS to get the general style of the inline block the way you like it. If you are using a JavaScript highlighter, such as highlight.js , you will most likely need to construct a JavaScript method to target the inline blocks as these may not be targeted out of the box. You may also find it useful to tag inline code with a different class than what is used for block code so you can also process and style them differently. The CSS class used can be configured independently for inline code in the options if using pymdownx.highight instead of CodeHilite. Custom Inline Blocks \ue157 Like SuperFences , InlineHilite now provides a support for custom inline blocks. Inline Math `#!math p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}` p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} Math Example For more indepth information on how to reproduce the example above, check out Arithmatex Documentation . Custom inline code blocks are created via the custom_inline option. custom_inline takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom inline code block. The dictionaries requires the following keys: Keys Description name The language name that is specified when using the fence in Markdown. class The class name assigned to the HTML element when converting from Markdown to HTML. format A function that formats the HTML output. The function should return either an ElementTree object or a string as HTML. Formatters \ue157 In general, formatters take four parameters: the source found between the backticks, the specified language, the class name originally defined via the class option in the custom_inline entry, and the Markdown class object. Should return a either an ElementTree element or a string as HTML. When returning a string, InlineHilite will treat the string as ready for HTML, so escape what needs to be escaped as it is expected to be fully ready HTML and will be stashed and re-inserted at post processing. When returning an ElementTree object, remember to wrap string content as markdown.util.AtomicString to prevent it from being processed further, you can also stash raw HTML string content assigned to elements like InlineHilite does by default above. InlineHilite will not try and guess what you intend, you must manage your content in the ElementTree objects or the Markdown parser may apply other conversion to your HTML content. def custom_formatter ( source , language , css_class , md ): return el # Or string Options \ue157 Option Type Default Description css_class string '' Class name is applied to the wrapper element of the code.

These individual key classes are great if you want to show special modifier key symbols before the key text (which is done in this documentation). The wrapper keys class can be customized with options, and the individual key classes are generated from the key-map index . If you would like to generate a key which isn't in the key index, you can extend the key map via a special option .

MagicLink can auto-link HTML, FTP, and email links. It can auto-convert repository links (GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket) and display them in a more concise, shorthand format. MagicLink can also be configured to directly auto-link the aforementioned shorthand format. If you happen to have some conflicts with syntax for a specific case, you can always revert to the old auto-link format as well: <https://www.link.com> . If enabled, repository link shortening will be applied to the the angle bracketed auto-link format as well. Auto-Linking \ue157 MagicLink supports auto-linking HTTP, FTP and email links. You can specify these links in raw text and they should get auto-linked. There are some limitations placed on MagicLink to keep it from aggressively auto-linking text that is not part of links. If you have a link that cannot be detected, you can always use the old style angle bracketed link format: <https://www.link.com> .

Shorthand Links \ue157 MagicLink supports shorthand references for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket issues ( #1 ), pull/merge requests ( !13 ), commits ( 7d1b190 ), and compares ( e2ed7e0...90b6fb8 ). You can also reference repositories ( facelessuser/pymdown-extensions ) and it supports mentioning users ( @facelessuser ). Mentions also works for social media (only Twitter is supported at this time). The syntax for repository providers is actually very similar to GitLab's syntax. GitLab was chosen as its syntax bridges the gaps between the three providers. GitLab and Bitbucket require a pull specific syntax while GitHub does not have one. I also preferred the subtle differences in GitLab's commit references as it was consistent with pull and issue syntax. Configuring \ue157 To enable shorthand syntax for code repository providers and social media providers, enable repo_url_shorthand and social_url_shorthand respectively in the options . To use this feature you must first specify in the options your provider to which all shorthand references are relative to, but you will still be able to reference outside of your defaults. And if you are specifying a code repository provider as your default, you must also specify the user and repo (repository) which adds more context and allows you to shorten the syntax even more for issues relating to your default user and/or repo . This is useful if you are using MagicLink to write documentation for a project that is hosted on one of the supported code repository providers. If you are using this extension more generally, it may make more sense to set a social media provider as the default provider . There is no need to set a user or repo for a social media provider as the context is not useful for mentions. You will still be able to reference repository links with shorthand if it enabled, albeit in a longer format. Warning Links are not verified, so make sure you are specifying valid issues, repositories, and users as they will be auto-linked even if they are not valid. Mentions \ue157 Mentions of other users are performed with the following syntax: @{user} . To reference a provider other than your default, use the format @{provider}:{user} Mention Example @facelessuser @twitter:twitter @facelessuser @twitter For code repository providers, you can also mention repositories. This feature is actually inspired by the GitHub only extension Python-Markdown/github-links , which performs similar auto-linking. The syntax to auto-link a repository with mentioning is very similar to auto-linking a user, except you append the repository to the user name like so: @{user}/{repo} . If specifying a non-default provider, the form would look like: @{provider}:{user}/{repo} . The output for repository mentions omits the @ symbol and will just show the user and repository, but you are free to style it with CSS to make it stand out more like has been done in this document. Repository Mention Example @facelessuser/pymdown-extensions @gitlab:pycqa/flake8 facelessuser/pymdown-extensions pycqa/flake8 Issues and Pull Requests \ue157 Issues and pull requests are specified with #{num} and !{num} respectively. To specify an issue for a non-default repository under the default user, prefix the repository: {repo}#{num} . And to specify a repository under a non-default user, prefix both the user and repository: {user}/{repo}#{num} . And to reference an external provider, use the format {provider}:{user}/{repo}#{num} . If the default provider is a social media provider, then only the latter syntax can be used. Issue Example Issue #1 Issue backrefs#1 Issue Python-Markdown/markdown#1 Issue gitlab:pycqa/flake8#385 Pull request !13 Pull request backrefs!4 Pull request Python-Markdown/markdown!598 Pull request gitlab:pycqa/flake8!213 Issue #1 Issue backrefs#1 Issue Python-Markdown/markdown#1 Issue pycqa/flake8#385 Pull request !13 Pull request backrefs!4 Pull request Python-Markdown/markdown!598 Pull request pycqa/flake8!213 Note GitHub actually gives pull requests and issues unique values while GitLab and Bitbucket can have pulls with the same ID as an issue. So with GitHub, you can use #{num} format for both issues and pulls, and GitHub will redirect you to the appropriate issue or pull. GitLab and Bitbucket must specify pulls different from issues, hence the !13 format. Though GitHub doesn't need to use the pull format, you can if you like. This format was actually borrowed from GitLab. Commits \ue157 Commit shorthand syntax is simply the 40 character commit hash value: {hash} . And much like issues and pull requests, you can denote a repository under the default user with {repo}@{hash} and a repository under a non-default user with {user}/{repo}@{hash} . Lastly, to reference an external provider, use the format {provider}:{user}/{repo}@{hash} . If the default provider is a social media provider, then only the latter syntax can be used. Commit Example 181c06d1f11fa29961b334e90606ed1f1ec7a7cc backrefs@cb4ecc5e7d8f7cdff0bb4482174f2ff0dcc35c61 Python-Markdown/markdown@de5c696f94e8dde242c29d4be50b7bbf3c17fedb gitlab:pycqa/flake8@8acf55e0f85233c51c291816d73d828cc62d30d1 181c06d backrefs@cb4ecc5 Python-Markdown/markdown@de5c696 pycqa/flake8@8acf55e0 Diff/Compare \ue157 GitLab offers a useful shorthand to specify links to compare differences between two commits. This has been adopted for all the supported repository providers. Specifying a compare link is very similar to specifying a commit link except you must specify the older hash and the newer hash separated by ... : {hash1}...{hash2} . To specify a compare for a non-default repository under the default user, prefix the repository: {repo}@{hash1}...{hash2} . And to specify a compare under a non-default user, prefix both the user and repository: {user}/{repo}@{hash1}...{hash2} . Lastly, to reference an external provider, use the format {provider}:{user}/{repo}@{hash1}...{hash2} . Compare Example e2ed7e0b3973f3f9eb7a26b8ef7ae514eebfe0d2...90b6fb8711e75732f987982cc024e9bb0111beac backrefs@88c6238a1c2cf71a96eb9abb4b0213f79d6ca81f...cb4ecc5e7d8f7cdff0bb4482174f2ff0dcc35c61 Python-Markdown/markdown@007bd2aa4c184b28f710d041a0abe78bffc0ec2e...de5c696f94e8dde242c29d4be50b7bbf3c17fedb gitlab:pycqa/flake8@1ecf97005a024391fb07ad8941f4d25c4e0aae6e...9bea7576ac33a8e4f72f87ffa81dfa10256fca6e e2ed7e0...90b6fb8 backrefs@88c6238...cb4ecc5 Python-Markdown/markdown@007bd2a...de5c696 pycqa/flake8@1ecf9700...9bea7576 Repository Link Shortener \ue157 MagicLink can also recognize issue, pull request, commit, and compare links, and render them in the same output format as the repository shortcut links feature. Unfortunately, mention link shortening is not presently supported due to the fact that MagicLink does not use any of the providers' API to verify user links, and some legitimate links can look like user links, but are not. If we specify long form URLs from external providers, they will be shortened appropriately. External Provider Example - https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/385 - https://bitbucket.org/mrabarnett/mrab-regex/issues/260/extremely-slow-matching-using-ignorecase pycqa/flake8#385 mrabarnett/mrab-regex#260 When specifying links that reference the configured provider , user , and repo , links will be shortened differently in light of that context.

Snippets is great for situations where you have content you need to insert into multiple documents. For instance, this document keeps all its hyperlinks in a separate file. Then includes those hyperlinks at the bottom of a document via snippets. If a link needs to be updated, it can be updated in one location instead of updating them in multiple files. Snippets is run as a preprocessor, so if a snippet is found in a fenced code block etc., it will still get processed. If the specified file cannot be found, the the markup will be removed. If you need to show a snippet example in fenced code, please escape it as listed in Snippets Notation . Snippets can handle recursive file inclusion. And if Snippets encounters the same file in the current stack, it will avoid re-processing it in order to avoid an infinite loop (or crash on hitting max recursion depth). Though it should be said, you should extreme recursion depth as you will hit Python's recursion limit. This is meant for simple file inclusion, it has no intention to implement features from complex template systems. If you need something more complex, you may consider using a template environment to process your files before feeding them through Python Markdown. If you are using a document generation system, this can likely be performed via a plugin for that document system (assuming a plugin environment is available). Snippets Notation \ue157 Snippets has two modes of inserting snippets: single line and block. Single line format is done by placing the following markup for the single line notation: --8<-- \"filename.md\" Or you can insert multiple files with block notation: --8<-- filename.md filename2.md --8<-- As you can see, the notation is ASCII scissors cutting a line followed by the file name. In the case of the single line variant, the file name follows directly after the scissors and is quoted. In the case of the block format, the file names follow on separate lines and an additional scissor is added afterwards to signal the end of the block. The dashes can be as few as 2 ( --8<-- ) or longer if desired ( ---8<--------- ); whatever your preference is. The important thing is that the notation must reside on a line(s) by itself, and the path must be quoted in the case of the single line notation. If the file name is indented, the content will be indented to that level as well. To reduce confusion in block format, it is advised to ensure the entire block is indented to the same level.

Create tabbed fenced code blocks . Ability to specify custom fences to provide features like flowcharts, sequence diagrams, or other custom blocks. Allow disabling of indented code blocks in favor of only using the fenced variant (off by default). Experimental feature that preserves tabs within a code block instead of converting them to spaces which is Python Markdown's default behavior. Reminder Remember to read the Usage Notes for information that may be relevant when using this extension! Nested Fence Format \ue157 Start and end fence boundaries are specified with either 3 or more backticks or tildes. Start and end fence boundaries must both use matching symbols (backticks or tildes) and must be of the same number of symbols. If start is 3 backticks, the fence will end with 3 backticks. Start and end fence boundaries must be aligned to the same indentation level. Content between fences must be indented at least the same amount as the start and end boundaries. Empty lines are exempted. If you are using a fenced block inside a blockquote, at the very least, the first line of the fenced block needs to have the appropriate number of > characters signifying the quote depth. > ``` a fenced block ``` Too many blank lines will cause a blockquote to terminate, so remember to use > markers accordingly if not marking every line. > ``` a fenced block > with blank lines ``` If using a fenced block as the first line of a list, you will have to leave the first line blank, but remember that the list marker must be followed by a space. -<space> ``` a fenced block ``` Definition :<space> ``` a fenced block ``` Fenced blocks should be separated from other blocks by an empty line. Paragraph. ``` a fenced block ``` Another paragraph. Tabbed Fences \ue157 SuperFences has the ability to create tabbed code blocks. Simply add tab=\"tab-title\" to the fence's header, and the code block will will be rendered in a tab with the title tab-title . If you do not provide a title with either tab= or tab=\"\" , but you've specified a language, the language will be used as the title. No case transformation is applied \u2013 what you type is what you get. Consecutive code tabs will be grouped together. Tabbed Code ```Bash tab= #!/bin/bash STR=\"Hello World!\" echo $STR ``` ```C tab= #include int main(void) { printf(\"hello, world\\n\"); } ``` ```C++ tab= #include <iostream> int main() { std::cout << \"Hello, world!\\n\"; return 0; } ``` ```C# tab= using System; class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\"); } } ``` Bash #!/bin/bash STR = \"Hello World!\" echo $STR C #include int main(void) { printf ( \"hello, world \\n \" ); } C++ #include <iostream> int main () { std :: cout << \"Hello, world! \\n \" ; return 0 ; } C# using System ; class Program { static void Main ( string [] args ) { Console . WriteLine ( \"Hello, world!\" ); } } In order to use tabbed code blocks, some additional CSS is needed. You can check out the configuration below which will show the CSS and the HTML it targets. Keep in mind the CSS is just the minimum to get you started. You can tweak it and modify it to get it how you like it. Tabbed Code Setup HTML < div class = \"superfences-tabs\" > < input name = \"__tabs_1\" type = \"radio\" id = \"__tab_1_0\" checked = \"checked\" > < label for = \"__tab_1_0\" > Tab 0 </ label > < div class = \"superfences-content\" > ... </ div > ... < input name = \"__tabs_1\" type = \"radio\" id = \"__tab_1_X\" checked = \"checked\" > < label for = \"__tab_1_X\" > Tab X </ label > < div class = \"superfences-content\" > ... </ div > ... </ div > CSS . superfences-tabs { display : flex ; position : relative ; flex-wrap : wrap ; } . superfences-tabs . highlight { background : #ddd ; } . superfences-tabs . superfences-content { display : none ; order : 99 ; width : 100 % ; } . superfences-tabs label { width : auto ; margin : 0 0.5 em ; padding : 0.25 em ; font-size : 120 % ; cursor : pointer ; } . superfences-tabs input { position : absolute ; opacity : 0 ; } . superfences-tabs input : nth-child ( n + 1 ) { color : #333333 ; } . superfences-tabs input : nth-child ( n + 1 ) : checked + label { color : #FF5252 ; } . superfences-tabs input : nth-child ( n + 1 ) : checked + label + . superfences-content { display : block ; } Preserve tabs \ue157 Python Markdown has an approach where it normalizes whitespace. This means \\r\\n is converted to \\n and \\t is converted to spaces. In 99% of Markdown, this is never really an issue, but with code blocks it can be. Tabs can sometimes be very useful for aligning certain kinds of data, especially when dealing with characters of varying width. Tabs in Content ============================================================ T Tp Sp D Dp S D7 T ------------------------------------------------------------ A F#m Bm E C#m D E7 A A# Gm Cm F Dm D# F7 A# B\u266d Gm Cm F Dm E\u266dm F7 B\u266d If you have a scenario where preserving tabs is a requirement, you can use SuperFences preserve_tabs option to prevent converting tabs to spaces inside fenced code blocks. This only applies to fenced code blocks. Indented code blocks and inline code blocks will still be treated with Python Markdown's default behavior. This feature is experimental and actually applies the fences before whitespace normalization and bypasses the normalization for the code content. Code Highlighting \ue157 Assuming Pygments is installed, code highlighting will be handled by Pygments by default. If Pygments is not installed, or disabled, code blocks will be created using HTML5 style tags for a JavaScript syntax highlighter: < pre class = \"highlight\" >< code class = \"language-mylanguage\" ></ code ></ pre > . If you disable highlight_code , specified languages will be ignored, and the content will be wrapped in a simple pre and code tags with no classes. Highlighting can be further controlled if either the pymdownx.highlight extension is used or if Python Markdown's CodeHilite is used. If CodeHilite is configured, it's settings will be used to configure highlighting, but CodeHilite support is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. It is recommended to instead use pymdownx.highlight extension. If pymdownx.highlight is included and configured, CodeHilite will be ignored. When using fenced code blocks, you can specify a specific syntax language to highlight with by specifying the language name directly after the opening tokens (either ``` or ~~~ ). Whether using Pygments or some other JavaScript highlighter, the syntax is the same, but please consult your highlighter's documentation for recognized language syntax specifiers. Highlight Example Source ```py3 import foo.bar ``` Output import foo.bar Showing Line Numbers \ue157 Line numbers are provided via Pygments and can either be shown per code block or globally for all. To show globally via CodeHilite or pymdownx.highlight , you must set linenums to True in the respective extension. To set line numbers per code block, you can specify a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present). Simply specify the starting line line number with option linenums=\"1\" . The setting is followed by the equal sign and the value must be quoted. Valid line numbers are n > 0. If linenums is enabled globally, this will just control the starting line shown in the block. Line Number Example Source ``` linenums=\"1\" import foo.bar ``` Output import foo.bar Pygments also has a few additional options in regards to line numbers. One is \"line step\" which, if set to a number n > 1, will print only every n th line number. The other option is a setting that can mark line numbers as \"special\" with a span and class special . If the special parameter is set to a number n > 0, every n th line number is given the CSS class special . So to set showing only every other line number, we could do the following. Line options are separated by a space, and \"line step\" is always the second option, so you must specify line start before line step. Nth Line Example Source ``` linenums=\"2 2\" \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` Output \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz To set every other line as special, you must set the third linenums option (specify line start and step before it). Special must be a value of n > 0. Special Line Example Source ``` linenums=\"1 1 2\" \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` Output \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz For JavaScript libraries, a class of linenums is written to the block. This may or may not be leveraged by your chosen highlighter. It is uncertain at this time whether line number support for JavaScript highlighters will be enhanced beyond this. Highlighting Lines \ue157 Via Pygments, certain lines can be specified for highlighting. This is done by specifying a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present). The setting is named hl_lines and the value should be the targeted line numbers separated by spaces. Highlight Lines Example Source ``` hl_lines=\"1 3\" \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` Output \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz Line numbers are always referenced starting at 1 ignoring what the line number is labeled as when showing line numbers. Highlight Lines with Line Numbers Example Source ```hl_lines=\"1 3\" linenums=\"2\" \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz ``` Output \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\" import foo.bar import boo.baz import foo.bar.baz Custom Fences \ue157 SuperFences allows defining custom fences for special purposes, like flow charts and sequence diagrams: Flow Chart Example Source ```flow st=>start: Start:>http://www.google.com[blank] e=>end:>http://www.google.com op1=>operation: My Operation sub1=>subroutine: My Subroutine cond=>condition: Yes or No?:>http://www.google.com io=>inputoutput: catch something... st->op1->cond cond(yes)->io->e cond(no)->sub1(right)->op1 ``` Output st=>start: Start:>http://www.google.com[blank] e=>end:>http://www.google.com op1=>operation: My Operation sub1=>subroutine: My Subroutine cond=>condition: Yes or No?:>http://www.google.com io=>inputoutput: catch something... st->op1->cond cond(yes)->io->e cond(no)->sub1(right)->op1 Sequence Diagram Example Source ```sequence Title: Here is a title A->B: Normal line B-->C: Dashed line C->>D: Open arrow D-->>A: Dashed open arrow ``` Output Title: Here is a title A->B: Normal line B-->C: Dashed line C->>D: Open arrow D-->>A: Dashed open arrow As shown above, SuperFences defines two default custom fences (which can be removed if desired) called flow and sequence , for flowcharts and sequence diagrams respectively. The default custom fences simply preserve the content between the fences so a JavaScript UML library can convert the content and render the UML. To see exactly how to set up UML like in this documentation, see UML Diagram Example . Custom fences are created via the custom_fences option. custom_fences takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom fence. The dictionaries requires the following keys: Keys Description name The language name that is specified when using the fence in Markdown. class The class name assigned to the HTML element when converting from Markdown to HTML. format A function that formats the HTML output. The function should return a string as HTML. validator An optional parameter that is used to provide a function to validate custom fence parameters. Formatters \ue157 SuperFences provides two format functions by default, but you can always write your own: Format Function Description superfences.fence_code_format Places the HTML escaped content of the fence under a < pre >< code > block. superfences.fence_div_format Places the HTML escaped content of the fence under a < div > block. In general, formatters take five parameters: the source found between the fences, the specified language, the class name originally defined via the class option in the custom_fence entry, custom options, and the Markdown object (in case you want access to meta data etc.). def custom_formatter ( source , language , css_class , options , md ): return string All formatters should return a string as HTML. Tip If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. Validators \ue157 The validator is used to provide functions that accept or reject provided fence options. The validator is sent two parameters: the language defined in the fence, and a dictionary of options to validate. Custom options can be used as keys with quoted values ( key=\"value\" ), or as keys with no value which are used more as a boolean ( key= ). SuperFences will parse the options in the fence and then pass them to the validator. If the validator returns true, the options will be accepted and later passed to the formatter. This custom fence: ```custom_fence custom_option=\"value\" other_custom_option= content ``` Would yield this option dictionary: { \"custom_option\" : \"value\" , \"other_custom_option\" : True } For a contrived example: if we wanted to define a custom fence named test that accepts an option opt that can only be assigned a value of A , we would write the following validator: def custom_validator ( language , options ): \"\"\"Custom validator.\"\"\" okay = True for k in options . keys (): if k != 'opt' : okay = False break if okay : if options [ 'opt' ] != \"A\" : okay = False return okay Then later the formatter would be given the options: def custom_format ( source , language , class_name , options , md ): \"\"\"Custom format.\"\"\" return '<div class_name=\" %s %s \", data-option=\" %s \"> %s </div>' % ( language , class_name , options [ 'opt' ], html_escape ( source )) This would allow us to use the following custom fence: ```test opt=\"A\" test ``` Tip If you are attempting to configure these options in a YAML based configuration (like in MkDocs ), please see the FAQ to see how to specify function references in YAML. UML Diagram Example \ue157 This example illustrates how this document uses the custom_fences option to do UML diagrams. The settings below shows two new custom languages called flow and sequence and are the options that must be fed through the custom_fences option . The flow and sequence fences will pass the content through the superfences.fence_code_format format function which will wrap the content in < pre >< code blocks and attach the class uml-flowchart or uml-sequence-diagram to the respective < pre > block. superfences.fence_div_format could just as easily be used to wrap the content in a < div > instead, or a new custom function could have been written and used. extension_configs = { \"pymdownx.superfences\" : { \"custom_fences\" : [ { 'name' : 'flow' , 'class' : 'uml-flowchart' , 'format' : pymdownx . superfences . fence_code_format }, { 'name' : 'sequence' , 'class' : 'uml-sequence-diagram' , 'format' : pymdownx . superfences . fence_code_format } ] } } As defined above, the custom UML diagrams are recognized when defining a fenced code block with either the language flow or sequence . When they are converted, the HTML element containing this content will have the respective classes uml-flowchart or uml-sequence-diagram . The format function we used in this example only escapes the content to be included in HTML. We will rely on JavaScript libraries to render our flowcharts/diagrams in the browser. The JavaScript libraries used to render UML in this document are flowchart.js and sequence-diagram.js . This extension does not provide these JavaScript libraries; you must provide the necessary JavaScript files for your custom fences yourself. If you wish to follow along with this example to enable UML, see the requirements below. flowcharts raphael.js flowchart.js sequence diagrams Minimum requirements for the latest version available via CDN (at the time of writing this). raphael.js underscore.js sequence-diagram.js All of the above mentioned libraries can be included using CDNs (you can use the version of your choice): < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/raphael/2.2.7/raphael.min.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore-min.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/js-sequence-diagrams/1.0.6/sequence-diagram-min.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowchart/1.6.5/flowchart.min.js\" ></ script > Simply including the libraries above is not enough as these libraries need to be pointed at the elements they need to convert. Also, we need to configure the libraries with the settings we would like. As mentioned earlier, our flowchart elements have the uml-flowchart class assigned to them, and the sequence diagram elements have the uml-sequence-diagram class assigned to them. Below shows an example script to convert the UML diagrams for both flowcharts and sequence diagrams using the listed libraries above. This script will target the elements with the classes uml-flowchart and uml-sequence-diagram . The script will pass the content to the correct library to render the content. It will then insert the rendered UML and remove the original source. This is just an example, and you are not required to use the following script. You are free to modify the example script or write your own to suite your specific custom fence. In the below example we create an onReady function to execute the conversion when the HTML is loaded. We create a convertUML function that takes the class name to search for, the converter to use, and a settings object to feed into the converter. We then call onReady and feed it a callback function that will execute convertUML for flowcharts and for sequence diagrams. Notice that convertUML can handle both the < pre >< code > format or the < div > format we mentioned earlier. The actual convertUML function reads UML instructions from our element and sticks it in a div that gets appended to our main HTML content (in this case we look for the the body tag, but it could be anything). We don't want to do it in place where our UML instructions are because it might be under an element that is hiding it with display: none (like a details tag); it won't render correctly if its parent is not displayed. After we render the SVG, we insert it back where it belongs throwing away the original element that had the instructions.

Normally Python Markdown does not parse content inside HTML tags unless they are marked with the attribute markdown='1' . But since this is run as a preprocessor, it is not aware of the HTML blocks. SuperFences is made to work with the default extensions out of the box. It will probably not work with other extensions such as Grid Tables, since that extension allows for characters to obscure the blocks like the blockquote syntax does (though this has been designed to work with blockquotes). Ideally fenced blocks need to be handled by a block parser, but there is much work to be done on Python Markdown's internal block handlers before this is possible. SuperFences works best when following the guidelines. If the guidelines are not followed, odd results may be encountered. For the reasons above, the nested fences feature really is just a workaround. But for a lot of people, this functionality is more than sufficient. Options \ue157 Option Type Default Description css_class string '' Class name is applied to the wrapper element of the code.

It is recommended to instead use pymdownx.highlight extension. If pymdownx.highlight is included and configured, CodeHilite will be ignored. When using fenced code blocks, you can specify a specific syntax language to highlight with by specifying the language name directly after the opening tokens (either ``` or ~~~ ).

Simply specify the starting line line number with option linenums=\"1\" . The setting is followed by the equal sign and the value must be quoted. Valid line numbers are n > 0. If linenums is enabled globally, this will just control the starting line shown in the block. Line Number Example Source ``` linenums=\"1\" import foo.bar ``` Output import foo.bar Pygments also has a few additional options in regards to line numbers. One is \"line step\" which, if set to a number n > 1, will print only every n th line number. The other option is a setting that can mark line numbers as \"special\" with a span and class special . If the special parameter is set to a number n > 0, every n th line number is given the CSS class special . So to set showing only every other line number, we could do the following. Line options are separated by a space, and \"line step\" is always the second option, so you must specify line start before line step.

Normally Python Markdown does not parse content inside HTML tags unless they are marked with the attribute markdown='1' . But since this is run as a preprocessor, it is not aware of the HTML blocks. SuperFences is made to work with the default extensions out of the box. It will probably not work with other extensions such as Grid Tables, since that extension allows for characters to obscure the blocks like the blockquote syntax does (though this has been designed to work with blockquotes). Ideally fenced blocks need to be handled by a block parser, but there is much work to be done on Python Markdown's internal block handlers before this is possible. SuperFences works best when following the guidelines. If the guidelines are not followed, odd results may be encountered. For the reasons above, the nested fences feature really is just a workaround.
